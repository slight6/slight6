- 👋 Hi, I’m @slight6, also known as Jason or Wolf. Many names, same great personality! I am in a good, positive mood and give off nothing but great vibes 
     about 98.7% of the time, my 5 year old did a scientific research paper on it once - the number is true, the paper is not. 
- 👀 I’m EXTREMELY passionate about coding, and the next generation of everything. I have been an auto mechanic for quite a few years, now trying to shift
     into the software development industry before it's too late. I feel my previous career helps give me a slight boost, or nudge toward the future of 
     electric vehicles in the coming years. I would love to bring my present to life by joining my past life with my future one. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, SQL, Java, HTML, CSS, JS, trying to stay away from frameworks until I have the basics covered.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything code related, some games interest me, although I am purely into the mecahnics, 
     I can't draw a circle with a compass. I work very well solo, or within a team. I have been guilty of overexplaining, 
     so forgive me if we converse and **THAT** happens. 
- 📫 The best place to get me is on discord under the tag Wolf J. Flywheel#9958 (include spaces) or my email which I don't answer much - jason@27pro.com
