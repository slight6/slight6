- 👋 Hi, I’m @slight6, also known as Jason or Wolf. Many names, same great personality! I am always in a good, positive mood and give off nothing but great vibes about 98.7% of the time, my 5 year old did a scientific research paper on it once - the number is true, the paper is not. 👀 I’m EXTREMELY passionate about coding, and the next generation of everything. I have been an auto mechanic for quite a few years, now trying to shift into the software development industry before it's too late. I feel my previous career helps give me a slight boost, or nudge toward the future of electric vehicles in the coming years. I would love to one day join my past life with my future one, and be involved in some type of long term EV project. 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, SQL, Java, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 💞️ Collaborations on projects really interest me as I really enjoy working well as a team player. Working solo isn't as daunting to me as it may be to some, so that's not an issue. I have been guilty of overexplaining, so forgive me if we converse and **THAT** happens. 📫 The easiest way to reach me is on discord under the tag Wolf J. Flywheel#9958 (include spaces) or my email admin@27pro.com
